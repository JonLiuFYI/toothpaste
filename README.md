# toothpaste 0.1
A simple Python 3 API for managing store inventories. Developed in a test-driven approach.

Requires Flask 1.0.2 and Connexion 2.2.0. Unit testing requires Pytest.

## Using toothpaste
To launch the server, in your terminal, go to the toothpaste directory and execute `server.py` or `python server.py` (if Python 3 isn't default on your system, use `python3 server.py` instead).

See API documentation and test run it: http://localhost:5000/api/ui

Run unit tests: run `pytest` in this directory.
